## How it works

KmpEssentials is a library that contains apis to accelerate your development. Everything from managing the Battery, File System, or getting Package information. 

[The new Website is live and you can find all documentation for KmpEssentials here](https://thearchitect123.github.io/ArtifactsDocProduction/develop/kotlin/multiplatform/kmpessentials/)

KmpEssentials is now available for SwiftPackages.
Simply add the url into **Xcode -> https://github.com/TheArchitect123/KmpEssentials**

And import the library into your target. There will be specialised documentation written up just for swift, but for now, in order to use one of the modules in your project please do this:

```module.companion.methodToInvoke()```

**So in order to invoke LocalNotifications, use:**

```KmpLocalNotification.companion.sendNotification("Title Of App", "Message of Notification")```
